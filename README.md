ThisPositionSeemsFamiliar is an idea for a chess web application. Normally when solving chess puzzles, the positions can seem quite artifical for those who have an eye for that sort of thing. The idea here is to convert a users' positions into puzzles that they can try solving again. Mainly, the puzzles will be generated from where a user missed a key move or idea in a position, and they will be given an opportunity to make that move again.
